    "text": "Pixel vs. Vector\nThe key difference between pixel and vector based graphics is how the image is structured. Pixel based graphics are made up from lots of tiny physical squares (or ‘pixels’) where as vector graphics are mapped out using mathematical equations which calculate where the edges of the shapes sit in relation to one another.\nAs an example; fonts are always created using vectors so that the colours can be changed efficiently and the symbol can be easily scaled up to any size without losing quality. In contrast, digital photographs are always made up of pixels, which allows for a much more efficient blending of the colours as each physical pixel block can be coloured individually – rather than each shape being mapped out and filled with a gradient, as it would have to be if it were made up using vectors.\n\n\n\nVector vs. Pixel Image\n\n\nPixel graphics use a grid of small, square picture elements (pixels) for displaying graphics. Each pixel has a particular position and a particular colour value. The total number of pixels in an image is always the same. If the image is enlarged, the resolution is reduced. Then the image often looks “jagged“. If an interpolation is used the image looks smooth but not as sharp. Dataforms: JPG, PNG, TIFF, GIF, PSD, BMP\nVector graphics are created from mathematically defined lines (vectors) and curves. Vectors draw pictures on the basis of their geometrical characteristics. Vector graphics are not defined by a fixed number of pixels. Therefore they are not dependent on resolution. During expansion the contours are scaled without affecting the quality of the pictures or increasing the quantity of data. Vector graphics are always displayed or printed in the resolution of the relevant output device. Therefore they are suitable for showing sharp contours and details. Dataforms: PDF, EPS, AI, CDR, WMF,\n\n\nDataforms\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEPS\nGIF\nJPEG\nPDF\nTIFF\n\n\n\n\nDescription\nEPS (Encapsulated PostScript) is actually a page description language but is also used for describing images, and especially vector graphics.\nGIF is in most cases used for screen presentations and animations.\nJPEG (Joint Photographics Experts Group) is the most common format on the Internet because it allows to compress images a lot without limiting the color range such as in GIFs .\nPDF (Portable Document Format) is produced by Adobe Acrobat and the format is based on PostScript (PS) format.\nTIFF (Tagged Image File Format) is one of the most common formats.\n\n\nPurpose\nA platform-independent printing format.\nGIF (Grafic Interchange Format) is the perfect dataform for Internet figures that only requires up to 256 indexed colours.\nInternet publications, presentations, never for print!\nA cross application/platform description and publishing format.\nPlatform independent format for photos etc. TIFF has become a defacto standard for pixel images.\n\n\nAdvantages\nEPS has been a de facto standard within the graphic industry during the last fifteen years. It offers a very good printing quality on PS-printers. EPS is mostly used for storing vector information.\nMost image software can import and export GIF-files. The file format offers extremely small files which is ideal for internet publications.\nThe format offers a very good compression, especially for photos. Thecompression will reduce the file size by approximately 5 to 20 times.\nVery good printing quality. A standard in desktop publishing. All information will be stored inside a PDF.\nThe format is supported in almost every image and word processing software, and it does not compress the data. Ideal for printing.\n\n\nDisadvantages\nThere are sometimes problems when printing these files on printers that don’t support the Postscript format.\nMaximum 256 colours can be stored in the file. That means that there is always a quality loss when you use it for photos.\nThe format uses a lossy compression. This means that you will loose information every time you save the image.You should not use JPEG as a master copy of your images.\nOnly limited options to edit a PDF-file.\nLarge images require large storage space. Not the best format for online publications.\n\n\n\n\n\nImage Resolutions\nTo determine whether your raster images are a suitable resolution for a specific application, you need to check their pixel density. Units of measurement such as dots per inch (DPI) or pixels per inch (PPI) refer to the number of pixels in one inch of the image. These measurements become important when you attempt to use raster images in specific places, such as on the web or in print publications.\nThe web, historically, displays 72dpi (72 dots or pixels per inch) – a relatively low pixel density however most modern displays are now much higher. That said many images on the web are still in that 72-100 dpi range. While monitors can display higher resolution the web also needs to optimize for speed so images around 100 dpi hit the sweet spot for looking great on a screen but also loading quickly. Raster images with a low DPI in the 72-100 look nice and crisp on the web. But this same low DPI image may not be suitable for printing. To correctly print an image, it should be at least 300dpi, a much higher pixel density than the web displays. Resizing a low DPI image pulled from the web to fit the dimensions of your print project won’t work because the same finite number of pixels only get bigger and begin to distort. For example, let’s say you want to print your logo at 2″x3″ on a brochure. If have a 72dpi jpg of your logo and it’s 2-inches by 3-inches, it will need to be “stretched” to more than 3 times the size to get it up to 300dpi. That 72dpi logo may look great on your computer monitor, but when it prints at 300dpi it will look pixilated. Instead you should use a vector version of your logo (.EPS or .AI) or create a raster (JPG) with the exact dimensions desired and at 300dpi."

An understanding of color theory helps to evaluate which colors work together, and which don’t.\nThe color wheel depicts the color spectrum in a circle and is made up of three different types of colors: Primary, secondary, and tertiary colors. The primary colors are red, yellow, and blue. They are called primary for a couple of reasons. No two colors can be mixed to create a primary color. Primary colors cannot be created by mixing together other colors, but only through the use of natural pigments.\nThe secondary colors are orange, green, and purple. Secondary colors are created by mixing equal parts of two primary colors. Tertiary colors are created by mixing equal parts of a secondary color and a primary color together. There are six tertiary colors; red-purple, red-orange, blue-green, yellow-green, blue-purple, and yellow-orange. When naming the tertiary colors, the primary color is always named first.\n\nThe color wheel can be divided into ranges that are visually active (warm colors) or passive (cold colors). Active colors appear stronger next to cold colors.\n\n\n\nThe Color Wheel\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColor schemes are practical guidlines on how to mix colors together.\nMonochromatic means one (mono) color (chroma). A monochromatic color scheme consists of only one color and its shades and tints.\nAnalogous colors are next to each other on the color wheel. They can have an intense yet harmonic effect.\nComplementary colors are found directly across from each other on the color wheel. They provide a strong contrast.\nColor triads are three colors that are equally spaced apart from each other on the color wheel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComplementary Colors are located opposite each other on the color wheel. Every visual presentation involves figure-ground relationships. This relationship between a subject (or figure) and its surrounding field (ground) will evidence a level of contrast; the more an object contrasts with its surrounds, the more visible it becomes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComplementary colors can have interesting and intense effects. This may be a desirable effect, or a problem if there is text involved.\n\n\n\nComplementary Colors\n\n\n\n\n\nValue is the darkness or lightness of a color. When dealing with pure color (hue), value can be affected by adding white or black to a color. Adding white to a color produces a tint. Adding black to a color produces a shade.\n\n\n\nColor Values\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColor blindness is the inability to differentiate certain colors. It comes in different forms, but the most common is red-green color blindness. There are multiple causes, but the most common cause is a mutated X Chromosome. Because men have only one X chromosome, they are more often affected by colorblindness Around 8% of adult men suffer from color blindness. Women on the other hand have two X chromosomes, which is why only few women are color blind.\nThe most common type of color blindness is red green color blindness, this type affects about 95% of all color blind people. It means that the affected person can either not see the color red or green or both as colors but only as shades of grey, and hence not distinguish between them. The remaining 5% of colorblindness is made up of blue yellow color blindness, and less commonly – total color blindness.\nBelow you can see an R package that tests graphic output for different types of color blindess. The first figure shows a graph as seen by a non-colorblind person. The second figure shows how different types of color blindness affect the vision of the same graph.

This is where the CMYK (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow and Key Color) color system is used.\nADDITIVE COLOR\nOn digital screens, colors are created with light. If we do not have any light, we see black. The more colors we add, the lighter it gets and ends in white. This is when the RGB color system is applied. Most pictures you find on the internet are in the RGB mode and thus not printable.

    "text": "Visualization may not be as precise as statistics, but it provides a unique view onto data that can make it much easier to discover interesting structures than numerical methods. Visualization also provides the context necessary to make better choices and to be more careful when fitting models. Anscombe’s Quartet is a case in point, showing that four datasets that have identical statistical properties can indeed be very different.\n\n\n\n).\n\n\nWhen we visualize data, it means that we are encoding data into visual forms such as colors, size, shape, etc. Although our data pretty much decides which type of graphs we can consider, the human brain cannot decode the information of all types of data visualization equally.\nIn the mid-1980s, Cleveland and McGill (1985) ran experiments measuring how accurately people were able to perceive the quantitative information encoded by different types of data visualization. People were asked to estimate two values within a chart, or compare values between charts. In 2010, Heer & Bostock (2010) replicated Cleveland’s earlier experiments and added additional assessments, such as rectangular-area graphs.\nThe overall pattern of results shows less accurate perception as we move from length-based scales to angles and finally areas.\n\n\n\nSource: Healy (2019)\n\n\nSchematic representation of basic perceptual tasks for nine chart types, by Heer and Bostock, following Cleveland and McGill. In both studies, participants were asked to make comparisons of highlighted portions of each chart type, and say which was smaller.\nWe best judge a quantity if we have a clear scale on which elements are aligned, such as a denoted y-axis for bar charts. When elements are not clearly marked by a scale, comparison is a bit harder but still good. It is more difficult again to compare the lengths of lines without a common baseline.\nWe tend to misjudge quantities represented as angles. This is why pie charts are usually a bad idea. We also misjudge areas. We have known for a long time that area-based comparisons of quantities are easily misinterpreted or exaggerated. For example, values in the data might be encoded as lengths which are then squared to make the shape on the graph. The result is that the difference in size between the squares or rectangles area will be much larger than the difference between the two numbers they represent.\nFinally, three-dimensional visualization of data is hardest to interprete. Our ability to scan the dimension of depth (z-axis) is weaker than our ability to grasp the x and y axes. Three-dimensional visualization can look impressive, but they are also harder to judge."

    "text": "Visualization may not be as precise as statistics, but it provides a unique view onto data that can make it much easier to discover interesting structures than numerical methods. Visualization also provides the context necessary to make better choices and to be more careful when fitting models. Anscombe’s Quartet is a case in point, showing that four datasets that have identical statistical properties can indeed be very different.\n\n\n\n).\n\n\nWhen we visualize data, it means that we are encoding data into visual forms such as colors, size, shape, etc. Although our data pretty much decides which type of graphs we can consider, the human brain cannot decode the information of all types of data visualization equally.\nIn the mid-1980s, Cleveland and McGill (1985) ran experiments measuring how accurately people were able to perceive the quantitative information encoded by different types of data visualization. People were asked to estimate two values within a chart, or compare values between charts. In 2010, Heer & Bostock (2010) replicated Cleveland’s earlier experiments and added additional assessments, such as rectangular-area graphs.\nThe overall pattern of results shows less accurate perception as we move from length-based scales to angles and finally areas.\n\n\n\nSource: Healy (2019)\n\n\nSchematic representation of basic perceptual tasks for nine chart types, by Heer and Bostock, following Cleveland and McGill. In both studies, participants were asked to make comparisons of highlighted portions of each chart type, and say which was smaller.\nWe best judge a quantity if we have a clear scale on which elements are aligned, such as a denoted y-axis for bar charts. When elements are not clearly marked by a scale, comparison is a bit harder but still good. It is more difficult again to compare the lengths of lines without a common baseline.\nWe tend to misjudge quantities represented as angles. This is why pie charts are usually a bad idea. We also misjudge areas. We have known for a long time that area-based comparisons of quantities are easily misinterpreted or exaggerated. For example, values in the data might be encoded as lengths which are then squared to make the shape on the graph. The result is that the difference in size between the squares or rectangles area will be much larger than the difference between the two numbers they represent.\nFinally, three-dimensional visualization of data is hardest to interprete. Our ability to scan the dimension of depth (z-axis) is weaker than our ability to grasp the x and y axes. Three-dimensional visualization can look impressive, but they are also harder to judge."

    "text": "Which chart type should I use?\nThis is a frequently asked question, and the answer is: There is no best answer. However, you should ask by asking yourself “What would you like to show?”. Below you can see a basic framework to identify different chart types for different data types. Experiment with different charts to see which chart works best to tell the story in your data.\n\n\nThe most important question you should always ask is: ““What is it about the data that I would like to visualize?”. The struggle of a good visualization is often find not a visualization problem, but an operationalization problem.\nInformation visualization is not an art, but a systematic process. You need to clarify which attributes of your data you want to highlight, and how these attributes relate to other attributes in the data.\nWhen is data visualization useful?\nThe less straight-forward the answer to your question, the more useful data visualization might be. If your question is ‘how many toothpastes did our company sell in a given year?’, you do not need to visualize the numeric answer to that question. However, if you ask how did our toothpaste sells do compared to other toothpaste companies in a given year, a graphic visualization might be useful to look at the differences and comparisons. Vague questions require you to look at your data from different perspectives and angles. Visualizating your data for vague questions can thus be useful to draw inferences based on your own knowledge.\nIn most statistic courses for social scientists, creating a graph is part of your statistical analysis. You’re being taught to create a graph from your results, to show your effects, or maybe look at the distribution of your data visually.\nThis ignors that information visualization can be of much greater use than only showing the outcome of an analysis. In fact, the most cited parts of a paper are usually the parts exploring, describing and interpreting the data at hand, which typically requires good and simple visualization. Exploring data visually might then give you indices on how to further work with the data, e.g. statistical analysis, machine learning, network analysis, etc. In other words, information visualization can be vital in the step to a successful operationalization.\nTypes of information visualization\n\n\n\nSource: McCandless (2013)."

The strength of time-series is the natural ordering of the time scale, and the ability to make big data sets with lots of variability easily visual.\nAdding an additional space dimension to time-series (if your data allows) increases explanatory power. The following examples show complex multivariate graphics that are so easy to understand that viewers barely notice the multiple dimensions.\nNarrative Graphics of Time and Space\n\n\n\nMinard’s visualization of Napoleon’s retreat from Moscow, Paris 1885.\n\n\nVisual Area and Numerical Measure\n\n\n\nAntonio Gabaglio, Teoria Generale della Statistica (Milan, second edition, 1888).\n\n\nMaps\nAs the importance of location data continues to grow so do the ways you can visualize this information. Maps are great for an intuitive to look at spatial patterns and great for distributing geographic data. In many cases, just by making a map you are doing analysis. That’s because you’re making the map for a reason. You have a question you want the map to help answer: Where has disease ravaged trees? Which communities are in the path of a wildfire? Where are areas of high crime? It’s also because when you make a map, as with any analysis, you’re making decisions about which information to include and how to present that information. Effective visualization is valuable for communicating results and messages clearly in an engaging way. Here are three key decisions that affect the information a map presents and the story it tells.\n\n\n\nSource: flowingdata.com (2019)\n\n\nTyler Vigen wrote an algorithm that attempts to automatically find things that correlate."

Too few data in a graph should always alarm you. Consider the example about traffic deaths in the ‘bad figures’ section.\nData-Ink\nGood information visualization should invoke your focus on the substance of the data and nothing else. Statistical graphics are instruments to help people reason about quantitative information. Data-Ink is the non-erasable core of a graphic, the non-redundant ink arranged in response to variation in the numbers represented. That ink changes as the data changes. You should try to maximize the share of data-ink in your graph. Erase non-data-ink within reason.\nChartjunk\nThe decoration of graphs produces a lot of ink that is not necessary to understand the data behind the graph. This non-data-ink is called chartjunk. This can include\n\nunintentional optical art (eye-catching visual additions to a graph that distracts from the actual information and distorts the reader)\nThe Grid (Grids are mostly for the intitial plotting of the data, but they carry no information and clutter up the graphic)\nSelf-promoting graphics (when the data measures and elements become the design elements)\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\ngap2007 %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(pop)) %&gt;%\n  slice(1:10) %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = country, y = pop)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +\n  labs(title = \"population of Countries in year 2007\") \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\ngap2007 %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(pop)) %&gt;%\n  slice(1:10) %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = country, y = pop, fill = country)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", color = \"black\", linewidth = 1.5) +\n  labs(title = \"population of Countries in year 2007\", x = \"This is the X Axis\", y = \"Some Very Large Numbers\") \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following example is adapted from Tufte (1983). He shows how data out of context can present untruthful results. When presenting results or effects, you should always show the answer to the question ‘compared to what’, such as time before/after or other units.\n\n\n\nAdapted from Tufte (1983)\n\n\nDesign that is too data thin should always raise your suspicion and you should consider the question ‘compared to what?’. Here, a few more datapoints lead to a completely different conclusion. In the first figure, one could assume that a stricter enforcement of speed limits lead to a significant decrease in traffic deaths. However, the second figure below shows that there was actually a sudden increase before the law enforcement. Thus, the drop might not be correlated with law enforcement.\n\nThe line connecting the two datapoints in the first figure could have a variety of other time-paths before and after.\n\nBringing other states into the picture further reveals that not only Connecticut had a sudden increase in 1955 in traffic deaths.\n\n\n\nAdapted from Tufte (1983)\n\n\nThink about the responsibility you have towards your reader. Depending on the platform and publication, showing an untruthful chart can lead to a lie being repeated thousands of times. Here are some principles you should consider in order to keep your graphs truthful (Tufte 1983, 77):\n\nThe representation of numbers should always be directly proportional to the numerical quantities represented.\nClear labelling should avoid ambiguities in interpreting graphs. In the best case, you write the labelling directly on the graph. Add important event labels.\nShow data variation, not design variation.\nGraphics shouldn’t quote data out of context\nThe number of dimensions in your graph should never exceed the number of dimensions in your data."
