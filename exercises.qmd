## ✍️ Exploring Gapminder

The following exercises help you explore real-world development data using `ggplot2` and `gapminder`.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🧠 Challenge Exercise: Explore a Development Pattern

Before seeing any example plots, try to visualize the following:

> **How does a country's population size relate to life expectancy and income level?**

**Your task**: Create a visualization using the `gapminder` dataset for the year **2007** that captures the relationship between:

-   `lifeExp`: Life expectancy
-   `gdpPercap`: GDP per capita
-   `pop`: Population

You may use any type of plot or mapping of variables (e.g. color, size), but **aim to show all three variables clearly**.
